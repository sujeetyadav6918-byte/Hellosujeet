<p class="text-red-600 font-bold"><strong>MEDICAL USES</strong></p>
<p>
Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab-axgb) is used in adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma whose disease has returned or not come under control after multiple lines of systemic therapy.
</p>
<p>
This approval is based on response rate; additional studies are ongoing to confirm long‑term clinical benefit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Recommended dosage (simplified):</strong> Premedication is given before each dose in Cycles 1 and 2 to reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and infusion‑related reactions. It is administered only as an intravenous infusion and each treatment cycle is 21 days.
</p>
<ul class="mb-3 list-disc list-inside">
  <li>Cycle 1, Day 1: 1 mg IV (over ≥4 hours).</li>
  <li>Cycle 1, Day 8: 2 mg IV (over ≥4 hours).</li>
  <li>Cycle 1, Day 15: 60 mg IV (over ≥4 hours).</li>
  <li>Cycle 2, Day 1: 60 mg IV (about 2 hours, if previously well tolerated).</li>
  <li>Cycle 3 and later cycles, Day 1: 30 mg IV (about 2 hours, if previously well tolerated).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Treatment is usually continued for up to 8 cycles as long as there is no unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. If a complete response is achieved by Cycle 8, treatment may be stopped. If there is only partial response or stable disease, therapy may be continued for up to a maximum of 17 cycles, depending on clinical condition and tolerability.

<p class="text-red-600 font-bold"><strong>Warning &amp; Precautions</strong></p>
<ul class="mb-3 text-black-900 text-500 list-disc list-inside">
  <li>
    Lunsumio can cause <strong>cytokine release syndrome (CRS)</strong>, which may be severe. If a patient develops CRS or symptoms that affect consciousness, they should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until symptoms have fully resolved.
  </li>
  <li>
    This therapy may also cause serious <strong>neurologic toxicity</strong> (including ICANS). Neurologic status should be monitored during each cycle, and any early signs should prompt a detailed neurologic assessment.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a risk of severe or fatal <strong>infections</strong>. Before and during treatment, monitor for signs of infection (such as fever, cough, or breathing difficulties); if there is an active infection, treatment may need to be delayed or avoided.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cytopenias</strong> (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) are common, so complete blood counts should be checked regularly. In cases of severe cytopenias, doses may need to be held, reduced, or the treatment permanently discontinued.
  </li>
  <li>
    In patients with bulky tumors, there is a risk of <strong>tumor flare</strong> and compression, especially near the airway or vital organs. These patients should be closely monitored during the initial cycles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Based on its mechanism, there is a potential risk to the fetus. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

Krazati is a breakthrough inhibitor of the RAS GTPase family designed to provide hope and effective treatment for adult patients battling KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This treatment is indicated for patients who have previously undergone at least one systemic therapy,
 as confirmed by an FDA-approved test. It’s important to note that this indication has been granted accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Further confirmation of clinical benefit may be required in confirmatory trials.

  Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, with appropriate supportive care as needed. Dose adjustments may be required based on the severity of symptoms.

  </li>
  <li class="mb-3">
  QTc Interval Prolongation: Avoid concurrent use of Krazati with products known to prolong the QTc interval. Regularly monitor ECG and electrolytes in at-risk patients or those taking QT-prolonging medications. Adjust the dose or discontinue treatment as necessary
   
  </li>
  <li class="mb-3">
  Hepatotoxicity: Before starting Krazati and monthly for three months after, as well as when clinically indicated, conduct liver laboratory tests. Dose adjustments, temporary suspension, or permanent discontinuation may be necessary depending on the severity of hepatotoxicity.
  
  </li>
  <li class="mb-3">
  Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis: Monitor for the development of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. If suspected, temporarily withhold Krazati and discontinue if no alternative causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.
